**Overview**

EDUbot is a sophisticated chatbot designed to provide informative and engaging responses to user queries. Leveraging the power of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and the Groq LLM, EDUbot is capable of accessing and processing vast amounts of information to deliver accurate and relevant answers.

**Key Features**

  * **RAG-Powered Responses:** EDUbot utilizes RAG to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base and generates comprehensive and informative responses.
  * **Groq LLM Integration:** The Groq LLM provides the foundation for EDUbot's natural language understanding and generation capabilities.
  * **Continuous Learning:** EDUbot can be continuously trained and updated with new information, ensuring that it remains up-to-date and accurate.
  * **User-Friendly Interface:** The chatbot interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing for seamless interaction.
